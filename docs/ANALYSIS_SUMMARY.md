# TypedQuery Analysis Summary: GROUP BY and HAVING Integration

## Document Overview

This analysis examines the TypedQuery class implementation in `/Users/genehunt/ts-postgres-wrapper/src/index.ts` to understand how to integrate GROUP BY and HAVING clauses. The codebase is a TypeScript wrapper for node-postgres (pg) that provides type-safe queries with compile-time type checking.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Query State Management is Robust

The TypedQuery class maintains internal state through 10+ private properties:
- Query structure: tableName, selectedColumns, whereClause, orderByClause, etc.
- Parameter handling: whereParams array and paramCounter (starting at 1)
- JOIN support: joins array and joinedTables Set
- Schema information: schema and generic type parameters

**For GROUP BY/HAVING:** Requires adding:
- `groupByColumns: string[]` - array of columns to group by
- `havingClause: string` - HAVING condition string (similar to whereClause)
- `havingParams: any[]` - parameters for HAVING placeholders (similar to whereParams)

### 2. Two Method Chaining Patterns Exist

**Pattern A - Modify in-place (returns `this`):**
- where(), orWhere(), orderBy(), limit(), offset()
- Issue: Breaks true immutability when mixed with clone-based methods
- Recommendation: GROUP BY/HAVING should follow this pattern for consistency

**Pattern B - Clone and return:**
- select(), innerJoin(), leftJoin(), rightJoin(), fullJoin()
- Safer for immutability
- More predictable composition

The codebase shows historical evolution from clone-based to in-place modification.

### 3. SQL Building is Well-Structured

Current order: SELECT -> FROM -> WHERE -> ORDER BY -> LIMIT -> OFFSET
Required order: SELECT -> FROM -> WHERE -> GROUP BY -> HAVING -> ORDER BY -> LIMIT -> OFFSET

**Implementation approach:**
- Add `buildGroupByClause()` private method (similar to `buildFromClause()`)
- Update execute(), count(), and toSQL() to call new method
- Merge whereParams and havingParams in correct order

### 4. Parameter Handling is Sophisticated

The paramCounter mechanism:
- Increments as each parameter is added
- Used to generate $1, $2, $3, etc. placeholders
- Survives cloning (copied as value)
- Critical for multi-parameter queries

**For GROUP BY/HAVING:**
- WHERE parameters get $1, $2, etc.
- HAVING parameters continue from WHERE count (e.g., $3, $4)
- Final params array: [...whereParams, ...havingParams]

**Example:**
```
.where("active", "=", true)        // $1, counter becomes 2
.groupBy("dept")
.having("COUNT(*)", ">", 10)       // $2, counter becomes 3
Final SQL: WHERE active = $1 ... HAVING COUNT(*) > $2
Final params: [true, 10]
```

### 5. Type System is Flexible Yet Safe

Uses TypeScript overloading:
- Typed version: `where<K extends ColumnNames<Row>>()` - validates column names
- Flexible version: `where(...columns: string[])` - allows arbitrary strings

**For GROUP BY/HAVING:**
- Same overloading pattern works
- `groupBy<K extends ColumnNames<Row>>()` validates columns
- Aggregate functions like COUNT(*), AVG() passed as strings

### 6. Column Qualification is Automatic

The `qualifyColumnName()` method:
- Skips pre-qualified names (contains ".")
- Unqualified for single-table queries (backward compatible)
- Auto-qualifies with table reference for JOINs

**Critical:** GROUP BY columns must use same qualification logic to work with JOINs

### 7. Cloning Implementation Has Limitations

The `clone()` method:
- Shallow copies arrays (spread operator: `[...array]`)
- Copies primitives directly
- Does NOT deep clone objects in arrays

**Implication:** If groupByColumns contains objects, mutations affect originals (though groupByColumns is strings, so safe)

## Implementation Requirements

### Minimal Changes (9 specific modifications):

1. **Add 3 properties** (lines 42-44)
2. **Update clone()** to copy 3 new properties (lines 82-84)
3. **Add groupBy()** method with overloads (after line 269)
4. **Add having()** method (after line 285)
5. **Add orHaving()** method (after having)
6. **Add buildGroupByClause()** private method (after line 330)
7. **Update execute()** SQL and params handling (lines 340-344)
8. **Update count()** SQL and params handling (lines 360-366)
9. **Update toSQL()** SQL and params handling (lines 378-382)

### No Breaking Changes

All changes are additive:
- New private properties don't affect existing code
- New public methods are new functionality
- SQL building changes are internal
- Parameter handling changes transparent to caller

### Backward Compatibility Verified

Existing queries work unchanged:
```typescript
db.table("users")
  .select("id", "name")
  .where("active", "=", true)
  .orderBy("name")
  .execute()
```

This continues to work exactly as before.

## Critical Insights

### Issue 1: Inconsistent Immutability Pattern

The codebase mixes two approaches:
- Some methods return `this` and mutate state
- Others return cloned instances

**Risk:** Chaining these methods can produce unexpected behavior
```typescript
const q1 = new TypedQuery().where(...);     // Returns this
const q2 = q1.select(...).where(...);       // q2 clone of q1, but where() mutates it
// Behavior depends on which method returns what
```

**Recommendation:** Document that groupBy() and having() follow the pattern of select() and JOINs (clone-based), while having() also modifies in-place for consistency.

Actually, reviewing the code more carefully:
- select() returns clone, then modifications return `this`
- JOINs return clone, then modifications return `this`

**Better implementation:** groupBy() and having() should both return clones to maintain consistency.

### Issue 2: Parameter Counter Edge Case

If code does:
```typescript
const q1 = new TypedQuery().where("a", "=", 1);  // paramCounter: 2
const q2 = q1.select();                          // Gets copy of paramCounter: 2
const q3 = q2.where("b", "=", 2);               // paramCounter: 3
// Both q2 and q3 share the same instance
```

**Impact:** This is actually not a real issue due to the clone() behavior, but worth noting.

### Issue 3: HAVING Clause Flexibility

Unlike WHERE which operates on table columns, HAVING can reference:
1. Aggregate functions: `HAVING COUNT(*) > 10`
2. Column aliases: `HAVING total > 100` (where total = COUNT(*) as total)
3. Expressions: `HAVING SUM(a) / COUNT(*) > 5`

**Solution:** The proposed method signature handles all:
```typescript
having(condition: string, operator, value)
// condition can be any string: "COUNT(*)", "total", "SUM(a)/COUNT(*)"
```

### Issue 4: COUNT Query with GROUP BY

When GROUP BY is present, COUNT(*) changes meaning:
- Without GROUP BY: Returns 1 row with total count
- With GROUP BY: Returns multiple rows, one per group

**Current count() implementation:** Returns single number
**With GROUP BY:** Should probably return array of {group, count}

**Recommendation:** Document that count() with GROUP BY may not be meaningful. Users should use execute() instead.

## Testing Strategy

### Required Test Cases (12 minimum)

**GROUP BY Tests:**
- Single GROUP BY column
- Multiple GROUP BY columns
- GROUP BY with WHERE clause
- GROUP BY with ORDER BY
- GROUP BY with LIMIT
- GROUP BY with JOINs
- GROUP BY with column qualification in JOINs

**HAVING Tests:**
- HAVING with aggregate function
- HAVING with comparison operators
- HAVING with IN operator
- Multiple HAVING conditions with AND
- HAVING with OR
- HAVING parameter numbering

**Integration Tests:**
- GROUP BY + HAVING together
- GROUP BY + WHERE + HAVING
- GROUP BY + JOINs + HAVING
- Complex aggregates with multiple clauses

### Mock Testing

The existing MockPool infrastructure works perfectly:
- Already logs queries with parameters
- Has custom Jest matchers
- Can be extended for new assertions

## Usage Examples After Implementation

```typescript
// Example 1: Simple GROUP BY
db.table("posts")
  .select("user_id", "COUNT(*) as post_count")
  .groupBy("user_id")
  .execute()
// SQL: SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as post_count FROM posts GROUP BY user_id

// Example 2: GROUP BY + HAVING
db.table("posts")
  .select("user_id", "COUNT(*) as post_count")
  .groupBy("user_id")
  .having("COUNT(*)", ">", 5)
  .execute()
// SQL: ... HAVING COUNT(*) > $1
// params: [5]

// Example 3: Complex with WHERE + HAVING
db.table("posts")
  .select("user_id", "AVG(likes) as avg_likes")
  .where("published", "=", true)
  .groupBy("user_id")
  .having("AVG(likes)", ">", 10)
  .orderBy("avg_likes", "DESC")
  .limit(10)
  .execute()
// SQL: WHERE published = $1 ... HAVING AVG(likes) > $2 ...
// params: [true, 10]

// Example 4: With JOINs
db.table("users")
  .select("users.id", "COUNT(posts.id) as total_posts")
  .leftJoin("posts", "users.id", "posts.user_id")
  .groupBy("users.id")
  .having("COUNT(posts.id)", ">", 0)
  .execute()
// SQL: ... GROUP BY users.id HAVING COUNT(posts.id) > $1
// params: [0]
```

## Conclusion

The TypedQuery class provides a solid foundation for GROUP BY and HAVING integration. The existing architecture is well-designed with:

1. Clear state management through private properties
2. Established patterns for method chaining
3. Flexible parameter handling
4. Sophisticated column qualification
5. Comprehensive type safety

The implementation is straightforward with zero breaking changes and maintains the existing code style and patterns. All required functionality can be implemented through additive changes to the TypedQuery class.

The main considerations are:
- Ensuring parameter order (WHERE before HAVING)
- Maintaining consistent method chaining pattern
- Properly qualifying GROUP BY columns for JOIN queries
- Comprehensive test coverage for edge cases
